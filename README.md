### Content:

Building Machine Learning model from **Scratch**, without using any ML package. Only use data processing package, e.g. Pandas and Numpy, and a package I made: Popanda (see the detail here: https://github.com/shawn120/Popanda_Enhance_of_Pandas) Then using some data set to test them.

Models include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Perceptron, and Decision Tree.
